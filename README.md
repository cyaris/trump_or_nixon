# trump_or_nixon
I practiced natural language processing with NLTK from some Nixon quotes and the New York Times' definitive list of President Trumpâ€™s lies. I then built a model using Naive Bayes classifier to predict who said each quote.

All Nixon quotes were obtained from https://www.thoughtco.com/richard-nixon-quotes-2733879

All Trump quotes were obtained from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html
